SOFRITO is a freely available tool, created to assist text mining efforts of biomedical literature. Some of the most common steps of such a project include corpus creation, entity extraction and normalization, retrieval of sentences (or other parts of a larger text) and finally, text classification with the purpose of discovering associations between specific entities of interest.
